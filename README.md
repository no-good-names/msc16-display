# MSC-16: Michael's Super-Awesome Computer

A simple 16-bit architecture, with an emulator

## Motivation

N/A

## Building

You can build the packages individually by invoking `make` in their directories.

The following are required to build all packages:

```
make
gcc
gperf
```

# MSC-16 Chip Spec

## Registers

### General Purpose:
A, B, C, D

### Special Purpose:
IP, SP, FLAGS

## Instructions

```

## Flags

```
0x1: Zero
0x2: Negative
0x4: Overflow
0x8: Interrupt Enable
```

## Memory

16-bit addressable memory

## Opcodes

All instructions are of 16-bit length, stored in memory in little-endian format

After reading from memory, we decode the instruction into the following format:

```
AAAA RRRR BBCC MRRR

A: Instruction
B: R1
C: R2
M: Mode (1 for immediate)
R: Reserved
```

In the case of an immediate value, the immediate value is stored in the next
two bytes of memory, again in little-endian format. Due to the way the opcode
is decoded, this format allows for duplicate opcodes.
